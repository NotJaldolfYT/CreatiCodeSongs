Oh Mario (Don’t save her)
She’s for the streets (Don’t save her)
Just let her go (Don’t save her)
Please don’t leave me all alone (Don’t save her, don't save her)
She even gave it up to Toad (Don’t save her, don't save her; what?!)

See upcoming rap shows
Don’t save her, don’t save her
She won’t act right (Don’t save her)
Can't turn a cheating princess to a housewife (Don’t save her)
Don’t save her, don’t save her
Don’t let her gaslight, she ain’t no victim (Don’t save her)
She came over last night (Don’t save her)
Don’t save her, she don’t wanna be saved
She won’t act right (Don’t save her)
Can’t turn a cheating princess to a housewife (She don’t wanna be saved)
Don’t save her, she don’t wanna be saved
Don’t let her gaslight, be lying when you catch her in the act like (Don’t save her)
Save me, Mario!
Please help me, Luigi!
No, no, no, I don’t think so
Why? Whatcha sayin’ bro?
That ******** is a ********
Luigi!
Why you out here simping?
She be creepin’ on the low
